            <h1>Lots of Late Night Youtube</h1>
            <small>5/17/2025</small>

            <p>When I made that <a href="/blog/week0.html" target="ethanlacking">that MiniDisc for Riley</a>, I had to be very choosy with what songs I put on it, because there's only so much 
                I could record to one disc. Unfortunately, that meant that I couldn't put all the songs I wanted you guys to hear, and worse 
                I even missed some songs that arguably would've been even better choices on the disc. Some of these songs are featured on those k-pop list videos that Mayu 
                puts on when it's late at night and we are tired of Overwatch. If a song's description seems a little short to you, it's probably because I heard the 10 seconds of it and put it in the playlist. 
                Without further ado, here they are.
            </p>

            <p>Damn that's a lot more than I thought. Well, if you wanna know what's up, read on, else, listen away. Or both, or neither. Up to you.</p>
            <p>By the way, this is now going off of my playlist order. No rhyme or reason to this, other than when I found them.</p>

            <h3>1. Find (Sieun & Seeun & J) - STAYC</h3>
            <p>This one you guys might actually have heard, because it was added in the last couple months before we all moved out. In case you guys forgot though, 
                it's another STAYC song. I don't know if it's exactly to either of your liking, but I think it's quite nice, so I'm mentioning it here.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Supersonic - fromis_9</h3>
            <p>I know you guys like fromis_9, and here I am spreading the good word. After a long drought of no music, they come back and drop this banger.
                Maybe you've heard this before, since this was also added before we moved out, but if you didn't, please listen to it. Please.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Supernatural - NewJeans</h3>
            <p>There was a whole thing with NewJeans that I still don't really know what happened, but they're on pause for the time being. If there's a boycott going on 
                I'll come back and update this page. For now, we have "Supernatural", which is technically a Japanese release, but I still wanted to mention it here because I like it. 
                Pretty snazzy track in my opinion.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Off The Record - IVE</h3>
            <p>I don't have a whole lot of IVE in my playlist, but when I first heard this track in Josh's car I added it real quick. Makes for a good night driving song, 
                and they do mention night a lot.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Tick-Tack - ILLIT</h3>
            <p>Fun Fact, my friend Mayu was wondering what song to put in the background of a video project she was working, and one of them was "Tick-Tack".
                This is in the same vein as Magnetic, and so is the other ILLIT song in this list, so have fun with that Scott. I mean I like it, very bubbly.
                And the instrumental is just a lot of fun.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Whiplash - aespa</h3>
            <p>This might be a weird pick, because you guys aren't the biggest fans of the aespa songs in the playlist. This song probably won't change that, but that's ok.
                Listen to it at least once, though, it's good. Hearing this live was even better (foreshadowing).
            </p>

            <h3>7. SHADE - YUKIKA</h3>
            <p>Riley, you should already at least know about this one, since it was in the pack of songs I gave to you last year.
                I could've put any YUKIKA song on this list, but this one is one of the most known for good reason, it's fire.
                Japanese woman making Korean city pop. The album this comes from, SOUL LADY, is hard to find. If you guys spot it, buy it.
                Not just for me, but for yourself.
            </p>

            <h3>8. BEAT BEAT - NMIXX</h3>
            <p>This song is just heat heat idk what else to say. If you don't like it flark you.</p>

            <h3>9. Bluerose - Billlie</h3>
            <p>A pretty chill and groovy track. Add Billie to the list of groups that I should've been on way sooner.</p>

            <h3>10. Backwards - Weeekly</h3>
            <p>A long time ago, you guys may have heard "After School" by Weeekly. If you remember that, then claim your OG quadrice ticket, because 
                it was part of the original playlist before I remade it without it. I kinda got sick of it, but who knows, it might come back. "Signal" did.
                Anyway, "Backwards" is a crazy shift away from "After School". Maybe you guys will like it, idk. 
            </p>

            <h3>11. Jazz Bar - Dreamcatcher</h3>
            <p>I feel a little silly for not including this one on the disc, because I think this is a bit more up your guys' alley. It's groovy, a bit jazzy, and not too crazy.
                And add Dreamcatcher to the "should've stanned" list, because I've come across a few more of their songs and I say that every time.
            </p>

            <h3>12. Sunny Side Up! - Red Velvet</h3>
            <p>Finally, some Red Velvet. A bit of a departure from the last song, since it's a bit more wacky, but that's just Red Velvet I think.</p>

            <h3>13. Hear The Sea - Red Velvet</h3>
            <p>And we got another Red Velvet. While I was writing about "Sunny Side Up!", I remembered about this one. I should've included it first, really, because this is one of their
                "velvet" songs. Think "Hello, Sunset". Plus, it's got sea in the title. #milo
            </p>

            <h3>14. Cherish (My Love) - ILLIT</h3>
            <p>ILLIT also comes back with another song on the list. This one I think is the title track from their album <i>I'LL LIKE YOU</i>. The other song is from there too. This also has a 
            lot of repeating syllables, though not as much as "Tick-Tack".</p>

            <h3>15. Glue - 9MUSES</h3>
            <p>I don't think I've ever said the word "nugu" around you guys, but basically it means groups/people who aren't widely known. I'm pretty sure I came across this song while watching a video about 
                hidden nugu gems, and yeah, this sure is one.
            </p>

            <h3>16. Faded Love - Wonder Girls</h3>
            <p>Another one from the Riley music pack, this song is so good I have to mention it. The whole album really, I don't know why I never looked beyond "Rewind", but yeah, this is my favorite song from 
                the whole list.
            </p>

            <h3>17. Smoke Sprite - So!YoON!, RM</h3>
            <p>Yes, you are seeing that correctly, that is indeed RM of BTS. When Josh was talking to me about So!YoON! and her solo career, he said that she has a song with RM that a lot of people like. 
                I said, "For Real?" Then he played it and I was wowed. But about Soyoon herself, I think she's pretty awesome. Her voice is a lot different from the other artists we've listened to, 
                which I like a lot, and makes her stand out nicely. The grungy guitar of the song is also very cool.
            </p>

            <h3>18. Where are you? - CLC</h3>
            <p>More of the slow 80s type of music, this time by CLC. I wish I could tell you guys more about them, but this is another song in the late night video binge collection.</p>

            <h3>19. Flower Rhythm - ARTMS</h3>
            <p>So I already told you guys about LOONA in <a href="/blog/week0.html" target="ethanlacking">the last article</a>, and the two soloists that came from them, Chuu and Yves. Now we have ARTMS, which consists of the members Heejin, Haseul, Kim Lip, Jinsoul, and Choerry. Coming back to the 
                fast poppy sound after the run of slower beats earlier in the list, this song is just a fun time.
            </p>

            <h3>20. Sparkling - SUMIN</h3>
            <p>BAM slowing back down with this one. Very groovy. The bass is crazy.</p>

            <h3>21. When We Were Us (Beautiful Days) - Lovelyz</h3>
            <p>Okay, back to the poppy upbeat stuff for real. Don't have much to say other than it's a fun listen, and that it's another late night find.</p>

            <h3>22. plot twist - TWS</h3>
            <p>This song is from a boy group. Shocking, I know, but it's really good. This one has been on the mind for a while actually, but I was hesitant to put it on the playlist because I wanted it to go on its own 
                boy group only playlist. I didn't have enough songs in mind to actually do that, but I also never really looked. Since then, there have been a few more bangers I've come across, and eventually I just said f it 
                and have everyone on the k-pop amalgamation list. Shoutout to Mayu for expanding my horizons.
            </p>

            <h3>23. LOVE BOMB - fromis_9</h3>
            <p>I don't actually know if you guys would be into this one, but it's so wacky that I just love it. It's from their earlier days, and that's pretty cool. I was zooming down the highway on the way to San Jose to this song.</p>

            <h3>24. TTYL - Loossemble</h3>
            <p>For the final banger on this list, we have "TTYL". Loossemble is the last of the post-LOONA projects that I haven't mentioned yet, consisting of members HyunJin, YeoJin, ViVi, Go Won, and HyeJu. If you weren't keeping count, 
                that's 12 members of LOONA. Two soloists and two groups of five members. This is gonna sound crazy, but I found this song on osu! because Josh mentioned that a map of this song got ranked. Too bad I suck and can't play it well, 
                but at least the song is fire.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>I hope you guys enjoyed the list, and that at least one of them makes it onto your playlists. Future ones definitely won't be as long. Talk tuah later.</p>
