            <h1>K-Pop Mix 2025</h1>
            <small>5/17/2025</small>
            <p>For the first article ever, before we get into the new stuff, I wanna talk about the MiniDisc that I made for Riley.
                It was the night before the long drive to San Jose, and I spent way too long recording the songs onto the disc with my RH1.
                I ended up sleeping a couple hours before I had to leave. I still had a great time, but man was I exhausted at the end of it.
            </p>

            <p>Anyway, if you wanna just see the list, here.</p>
            <ul class="lops">
                <li>Love - f(x)</li>
                <li>Roman Porno - Crystal Tea</li>
                <li>Keeper - TWICE</li>
                <li>Go Back - Se So Neon</li>
                <li>Maybe it's not our fault - Yerin Baek</li>
                <li>Back in town - CHUU</li>
                <li>GPT - STAYC</li>
                <li>High Horse - NMIXX</li>
                <li>Moonlight Distortion - Crystal Tea</li>
                <li>Ash - LE SSERAFIM</li>
                <li>Attitude - fromis_9</li>
                <li>Vision - (G)-IDLE</li>
                <li>Hi High - LOONA</li>
                <li>Sunrise - GFRIEND</li>
                <li>DIM - Yves</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are all songs that I played on repeat at one point or another, and what I thought that Riley would like, now I'm gonna ramble about them.</p>

            <h3>1. Love - f(x)</h3>
            <p>The first song starts off strong, giving a nice upbeat sound, and it's from second gen girl group f(x). We've seen them before during those k-pop radios, but I never had a song from them on the playlist until now.
                Shoutout to my friends Mayu and Josh for making me watch kpop videos until 3 in the morning for this song. In fact, they showed me a lot of bangers I probably never would've found on my own.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Roman Porno - Crystal Tea</h3>
            <p>This one should be familiar to you Riley because I played the whole album, <i>Pink Movie</i>, multiple times when I visited last year.
                Honestly, there might be other songs from the album you might like more, but this is the one I really like. Thank you Josh for this recommendation.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Keeper - TWICE</h3>
            <p>Now we got some TWICE in here. I was gonna have it be the first track on the disc but I think it was better to put it off for a bit, as if you were coming home to a surprise party.
                This is from their album <i>Strategy</i>, which the title track on it featuring Megan Thee Stallion. It's probably my favorite title track from them, maybe even top 10 overall, but I chose this song to be on the disc 
                because I think it's more suited to your guys' tastes. The rest of the album is great too, I think there might be some stuff you guys would like.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Go Back - SE SO NEON</h3>
            <p>This song is pretty different because it's made by a whole band, and that's pretty cool. Many of the members left though, and now it's just the guitarist and vocalist So-yoon. She also has a solo career under the name So!YoON!.
                She's made some epic bangers, which I will talk about another time.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Maybe it's not our fault - Yerin Baek</h3>
            <p>Another Joshua pick. I don't really have much to say about this one other than I like it. Very chill. I'm definitely gonna listen to more of her stuff and get back to you guys.</p>

            <h3>6. Back in town - CHUU</h3>
            <p>Surely you guys have seen CHUU around on the internet, she's really popular. She was in LOONA, but got kicked. More on that later. This is from her latest comeback <i>Only cry in the rain</i>. I was actually gonna put the title track on the disc, but I actually went with
                "Back in town" because it's a bit groovy and thematic. I implore you guys to at least listen to the title track because it's good.
            </p>

            <h3>7. GPT - STAYC </h3>
            <p>I didn't have much STAYC on my playlist back when we lived together, I think it was only "SO BAD" and "ASAP". Well here is some more because I've gotten to listen and like a lot more. I think this song is fun and catchy, and probably my favorite on this whole list.
                It's about someone who is difficult to reach and talk to. Reminds me of a certain someone...(jk)
            </p>

            <h3>8. High Horse - NMIXX</h3>
            <p>It was really hard to pick which song from <i>Fe3O4: Forward</i> (I've begun to call it Magnetite Forward) to include on the disc because they're all so good. I don't know how much you guys liked NMIXX on my playlist,
                but dang do I want you guys to at least listen to this. If you like it, go listen to the rest of the album, or "Papillon".
            </p>

            <h3>9. Moonlight Distortion - Crystal Tea</h3>
            <p>We have another Crystal Tea song, this time from <i>Pink Movie Director's Cut</i>. The two of them are so good I have both albums together on one disc. This song is my favorite of the two on this disc. Kinda evokes a more mysterious feeling, 
                while still being a fun listen.
                Actually, the placement of this one and Roman Porno is intentional. The first Crystal Tea song is supposed to set a sort of chill playful tone, while this one tells you that we're in for some more intense and powerful stuff.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Ash - LE SSERAFIM</h3>
            <p>Another familiar group to you guys, which I deliberately put in the later half for more of that coming home feeling. From their latest comeback <i>HOT</i>, this is my favorite song on that album. 
                Kinda ethereal and less upbeat, unlike Jewelry, but I hope you guys like it all the same.</p>

            <h3>11. Attitude - fromis_9</h3>
            <p>I'm going to put more fromis_9 in the playlist, because dang this one is crazy. Totally different from the other fromis_9 songs on there, I think.</p>

            <h3>12. Vision - (G)-IDLE</h3>
            <p>I only put the G there because I know you guys don't keep up with the times. They're i-dle now. I put this one on when I play Overwatch and I've been on a losing streak. 
                It's like a good luck charm. Doesn't always work.</p>

            <h3>13. Hi High - LOONA</h3>
            <p>You guys probably heard of LOONA too, or maybe not because you guys aren't that online. For a long time I always thought of the jokes, but after listening to this in another late night k-pop list binge I was converted immediately. Too bad there's a boycott going on,
                but that's what the point of the internet is. After Chuu got kicked, all the members filed to terminate their contracts. So after some legal stuff all the members eventually broke free and are now doing 
                various things. Trust that I will be talking about them in future posts.
            </p>
            <p>Also, I made a <a href="https://youtu.be/J71yJDDzaT4" target="__blank">small overwatch clip dump</a> to this song.</p>

            <h3>14. Sunrise - GFRIEND</h3>
            <p>This group has a sound that's very different from the other groups I've listed so far. Very powerful, I can't help but imagine my own opening to something whenever I listen to this song. They're very popular too,
                I feel like I should've put us on back when we were living together. I put this song near the end because I wanted to keep the energy shift from Hi High going, but also give a sort of finality to the disc. Only to be greeted with the real ending song.
            </p>

            <h3>15. DIM - Yves</h3>
            <p>Finally, but certainly not leastly, is "DIM". Perhaps, you (Scott) have heard this one on TikTok, since it recently went viral. I half claim my OG ticket because I was listening to Yves since the beginning of this year.
                She's really great, another soloist from LOONA. The album this song comes from, <i>I Did</i>, is great. She has another song, "LOOP", that's also really good, but I don't know if it's to your guys' taste. In any case, I chose this song to be the last one 
                because I wanted to give a feeling of something beyond, like less of a goodbye, and more of a see you later type. You know what I mean? 
            </p>


            <br>
            <p>Yep, that's it for the first list. I hope y'all liked it. If you aren't Scott or Riley, I hope you enjoyed the thoughts of a random guy and his k-pop journey. I've only been a fan for a couple years at this point.
                So while I feel like I've got a good hold on everything, there's still so much out there.
